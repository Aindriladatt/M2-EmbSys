# SUMMARY:

If the circuit is constructed as shown above, if initially the water in the tank is below minimum threshold, and the system is turned ON, the pump will start pumping water into the tank, and no LED will come ON, but immediately water reaches the minimum threshold, the yellow LED will come ON, indicating that the tank is one third full. As water keeps pumping, when the tank is two third full the red LED will come ON, and when the tank is full, the blue LED will come ON while the pump switches OFF automatically. If water starts receding from the tank, the LEDs will start going OFF gradually to indicate the level of water in the tank as it recedes & purple LED turns ON. Finally when water has got to the minimum threshold, the pump will come ON again.
